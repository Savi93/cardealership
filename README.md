# Cardealership SW

The application could be useful in a car shop to manage the collection of cars they sell. 
The different sellers can visualize all the cars they are selling and also give information to an eventual buyer filtering by brand, model, color, horse power, production year, price and km; moreover, a seller can add new cars, update same parameters or delete them when are bought. The admin user can delete all the sellers, while all the other can delete only their own account. 
The admin user can not be deleted. The data (sellers and list of cars) is persistently stored in a Database.
